üîê Authentication
-----------------

‚úÖ Unofficial method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**important notes:**

    - **This method is for educational purposes only and its use is at your own risk.** See `disclaimer <https://meapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#disclaimer>`_.
    - In this method you are going to verify as a user of the app and get a token with access to all the actions that the app provides.
    - After verification, if you are connected to another device, Chances are you will be disconnected.
    - For app users there is an Rate-limit of about ``350`` phone searches and ``500`` profile views per day.

**Verification:**

- Run this code:

.. code-block:: python

    from meapi import Me
    me = Me(phone_number=1234567890) # Enter your phone number

- If you have not verified this number before, you will see the following prompt in the terminal:

::

    To get access token you need to authorize yourself:
    * WhatsApp (Recommended): https://wa.me/972543229534?text=Connectme
    * Telegram: http://t.me/Meofficialbot?start=__iw__XXXXXXXXXX // Your phone number instead of the 'XXXXX'

    ** Enter your verification code (6 digits):

- Go into `WhatsApp <https://wa.me/972543229534?text=Connectme>`_ (+972543229534) and send any message to this number.
- You can also verify by ``Me`` Telegram bot (Only if you have Telegram account on this number!) and get verification code of 6 digits.
- Enter the code in the terminal and you will see if the verification was successful.
- If this is a new number that is not already open an account, you will be required to fill in some details like name and email in order to create an account.
- If you keep getting ``404`` error, you may want to run the :py:func:`~meapi.Me.upload_random_data` function, in order to activate the account.

**Registration:**

- You can also initialize the client with the necessary information in advance, good for cases of creating a new account:


.. code-block:: python

    from meapi import Me
    from meapi.models.others import NewAccountDetails

    data = NewAccountDetails(
        first_name="Phoebe
        last_name="Buffay",
        email="reginaphalange@friends.tv"
    )

    me = Me(
        phone_number=972123456789,
        activation_code='123456',
        new_account_details=data
    )

**SMS or Call:**

    Many ask me why there is no option to verify via SMS or call.

    Well, This is because authentication via WhatsApp and Telegram, is action of the user who sends a message to the bot and receives
    the verification code, as opposed to a call or SMS that requires an external service (which of course costs money) to make
    the call or send the SMS.

    This is why at the app level, ``Me`` Apps used a secret key to generates a time-based hashed session token.

    For obvious reasons I can not provide the key, but if you have knowledge of extracting secrets from APKs, look for the key and export
    it in the environment variables with the key ``ANTI_SESSION_BOT_KEY``.
    meapi will detect the presence of the environment and offer you to use authentication via SMS or call.

- Needless to say, the functionality is for educational purposes only.

**Credentials:**

- The default credentials manager is the ``JsonCredentialsManager``, which saves the credentials in a json file (``meapi_credentials.json`` by default).
- You can implement your own credentials manager by implementing the CredentialsManager interface. See `Credentials Manager <https://meapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/credentials_manager.html>`_.
- If you choose to use in the default credentials manager, the config file will be created in the location from which the library was called.
- The config file ``meapi_credentials.json`` format is:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "972123456789": {
            "access": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.XXXXX",
            "pwd_token": "XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX",
            "refresh": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.XXXXX"
        }
    }

- You can copy/move this file between projects. Just specify the path to the config file in when you initialize the Me class:

.. code-block:: python

    from meapi import Me
    me = Me(phone_number=123456789, JsonCredentialsManager(config_file="/home/david/meapi_credentials.json"))

üîì Official method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- You can also use the official verification and verify directly with an access token.
    Me has an official API which can be accessed by submitting a formal request at `this <https://meapp.co.il/api/>`_ link (Probably paid).
    I guess you get a API KEY with which you can get an access token similar to the app.
    But I do not know what the scope of this token are and whether it is possible to contact with it the same endpoints that the official app addresses.
- If anyone can shed light on the official authentication method, I would be happy if he would `contact me <https://t.me/davidlev>`_. so that I could better support it and exclude or add certain functions.
- If you have an access token and you are interested in connecting with it - do the following:

.. code-block:: python

    from meapi import Me
    me = Me(access_token='XXXXXXXXXX') # Enter your access token
